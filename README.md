## Organization

### Assets
- Visual: All non-code based visual assets, icons, sprites, pngs, animation libs, etc
- Audio: SFX, Music, etc
- Scr: Scripts, Utils, Components, Autoloads, and Shadercode

### WIP
- Each contributor will have a folder with wip-[your name]
- Any completed tasks should be placed into  wip-staging
**EXCEPTION** The "GameTemplate" will exist in main as many of its scripts are hardcoded to file paths.
This will mostly be handled by Vrood.

GameTemplate includes Pausing, AV Controls, Input Handling, Saving, User Configs, and scene transitions

### Main
- This is, ideally, the final product's directory.
